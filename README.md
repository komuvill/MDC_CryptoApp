# MDC_StockApp

This is a course work for Mobile Data Communications course. The purpose of the work was to develop a simple application that communicates with some data source on the internet and does something meaningful with the fetched data. We used Alpha Vantage API, which we use to fetch stock, cryptocurrency and FX data. A Java wrapper for the API by github user patriques82 was used to streamline our development process. Currently you can fetch IntraDay stock & cryptocurrency data with our app and draw a simple graph of the data. The user can also make currency conversions between national currencies and cryptocurrencies. In our current version the user must know the symbol for the stock or currency being searched. Alpha Vantage combined with patriques82's wrapper has proved to be a versatile and easy-to-implement platform so we are confident we could develop a really robust application with more development time.

Used APIs and libraries:
